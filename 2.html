Other MDN localization
For the moment, the new MDN platform UI will only be in English.
This is a problem that we are going to get to later on.

KumaScript macros are still going to work on the new MDN platform,
 but we will eventually phase them out as we build up the new platf
 orm. For now, they will continue to work as before, '
 and are still edited via pull requests to the macro files inside
  the Yari repo.
